# nmapSelector  

A short script selecting between thorough and sequencial nmap scan modes.  
use:  
`-m thorough` to run an extensive scan  
`-m all-ports` to run a scan on all ports  
`-m stealth` for CTF labs that need a more stealthy scan (Note: stealth mode needs the script to be run as sudo because of the `-sS` and `-f` options)  
...more modes to be added in the future
